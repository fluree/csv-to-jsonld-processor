An Inventory Status of \"In Stock\" means that there is adequate supply of inventory within the Warehouse location.  Finally, an Inventory Status of \"Overstock\" means that there is too much capacity for that material in inventory and speaks to either poor demand management processes, assembly line operational issues where batches are not being produced at the expected efficiency rate, or delays in entire assembly lines due to other potential materials being out of supply.",
